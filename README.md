# Patient Churn Analysis with K-Means Clustering and Predictive Modeling

This project analyzes patient churn in a healthcare clinic, focusing on identifying high-risk patients who may cease engagement with the clinic. By understanding the drivers of patient churn, the clinic can implement targeted strategies to enhance patient retention, improve health outcomes, and maintain financial stability.

## Project Overview

This project leverages clustering and predictive modeling to gain insights into patient churn. The primary objectives are:

- **Segmentation of Patients**: Using K-Means clustering to group patients into distinct clusters based on demographics, appointment behaviors, and geographic data.
- **Churn Prediction**: Training a Random Forest model to predict patient churn probability based on past engagement data.
- **Financial Impact Estimation**: Calculating Expected Lifetime Value and No-Show Costs to understand the economic impact of churn and missed appointments.

By combining clustering with predictive modeling, this project highlights which patients are most at risk of churning, providing actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes synthetic patient data with columns such as:

- `PatientID`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Diagnosis`, `Distance_From_Clinic`, `Income_Range`, `Insurance_Status`, `Patient_Active`
- `AppointmentID`, `Appointment_Date`, `Day_Of_Week`, `Appointment_Time`, `No_Show`, `Reminder_Type`
- `Previous_No_Shows`, `Travel_Time`, `Traffic_Delay`, `Weather`, `Transportation_Method`, `Cluster`, `Churn`
  
The data also includes calculated columns `Expected_Lifetime_Value` and `Expected_No_Show_Cost` to estimate the financial impact of churn.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   
2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Segmenting patients into clusters based on demographic and engagement features to understand different patient types and their churn likelihood.

3. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Training a Random Forest model on patient features to predict the likelihood of churn, allowing the clinic to focus retention efforts on high-risk patients.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Extracting feature importances from the model to identify the primary factors influencing patient churn, with insights to inform targeted engagement strategies.

5. **Financial Impact Estimation**:
   - Calculating Expected Lifetime Value and Expected No-Show Cost per patient to quantify the revenue potential and costs associated with no-shows.

## Key Findings

- **Top Churn Indicators**: Previous no-shows, distance from the clinic, and travel time emerged as the strongest indicators of patient churn.
- **High-Risk Patients**: The analysis identifies the top 10 active patients most at risk of churning, enabling proactive engagement strategies.
- **Financial Insights**: The calculated Expected Lifetime Value and No-Show Cost highlight the economic impact of patient churn, providing a clear incentive for reducing no-show rates.


## Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how clustering and predictive modeling can effectively identify and mitigate patient churn in a healthcare setting. By prioritizing high-risk patients for targeted engagement, clinics can not only enhance patient outcomes but also protect their revenue from the financial impact of no-shows and churn.
